# Automobile

Written while I was at De Anza College studying Advanced Java.
This was a backend written from the ground up using Java and ApacheTomCat.

The objective was to create a web application that utilized the Java backend to 
create a kelly blue book like website. Cars could be customizable, were serialized in a format 
designed by the student. Given some input file, a database was initialized for the application,
it was then written accessible once hosted by a WAR file on AWS.

The course was led by Bob Singh, and I did not finish the project.
